# Note-Taking
Github repository: https://github.com/gitkcb/note-taking
Launched Heroku page: https://note-taker-kb-2022.herokuapp.com/

## Description
This app was created to use the express.js skills learned in class to allow users to write notes and have them posted and recieved from a backend server. The motivation for this app was to allow a user to write a note with a subject title to be stored and recieved at the users convenience. This allows the user to access their notes from their computer instead of a notebook. I learned how to route back-end server requests using get and post methods. 

## Usage
To use this app you create a note title and then fill out the note body. Once this is done the user and save the note and it will be saved on the left hand column to refer back to. To open the note the user can double-click the saved note from the left column and the note will reopen on the right hand side.
